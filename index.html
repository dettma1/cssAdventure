        <p>Ada Lovelace was born in the 1800s. In her mid 30s she worked with Charles Babbage, known as the father of computing. 
        She wrote an algorithm designed to be carried out by the machine Babbage was working on. Her manuscript is titled <i>"Notes"</i>
        and is regarded as the first computer program, making Lovelace the first computer programmer.</p>

        <p>Grace Hopper is famous for coining the term "bug" (when code doesn't run correctly) when she found a moth in her own computer. 
        Hopper was working in the Navy on computing when she suggested a new programming language be invented that used entirely English words. 
        She was told computers couldn't understand english and the idea was absurd. Hopper then invented the first compiler, which takes human readable code and translates it into machine readable code.</p>

              <p class="card-text"> Many story-telling games feature enemies, or bad characters. In this case, the mermaid and manatee are working to protect their kingdom and keep it hidden from the humans, symbolized by the submarine. I really like having the enemy be a submarine, because it does not work as a personal attack on any group of people (expect many submarine seafarers). While the manatee and mermaid are working against someone else, the game is not centered on violence. Instead, they must rely on trickery, innovation, and creativity to outwit the submarine.   </p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Gameplay</h5>
            <p class="card-text">The game has minimal instructions and is meant to be played through a process of exploration. I love computer science because you are able to quickly try out new ideas and adjust them along the way. This idea incorporated through moving the blue fish and trying to find the location of the manatee. Currently, the game only has one "puzzle," but the idea would be to expand the game to a series of puzzles that create a narrative together. They would increase in difficulty and the ending result would be involve some python code or scratch-like coding exercise of putting code into the correct order. By the end of the game, I am hoping girls will have more of an understanding of how computer science works, and the creativity and problem-solving necessary.</p>

           <p>I first thought of the idea of CSS Adventure the summer after my freshman year of college. I found I had a lot of free time at my summer internship and often spent it designing app ideas or thinking of things to build out. My first year of college had given me a lot of insight into the tech world and I was still in the honeymoon phase. I wanted <i> everyone</i>  I knew to be doing computer science and thought if people had an opportunity to try it out they would be more apt to consider it as an option. I have since learned the lack of women in computer science is a long and complicated matter, but still believe introducing girls to computer science is a good idea. This is how CSS Adventure was born. </p>
